# LazyApp
This repo is a TUI inspired by lazydocker and lazygit that I am building as part of my journey into learning Rust. My goal is to integrate this with some sort of tool or api. 

## Setting up
Start by cloning this repository to your machine. Ensure you have the Rust language installed. This can be easily installed via homebrew:

```bash
brew install rust
```

In the root of the project, you can run the application by running `cargo run`.
